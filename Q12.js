// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names = ["Sarwat", "Zohaib", "Zayan", "Ayesha",];
var message = "Do you like to play football?";
console.log(names[0] + " " + message);
console.log(names[1] + " " + message);
console.log(names[2] + " " + message);
console.log(names[3] + " " + message);
